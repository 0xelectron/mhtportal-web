		Mht Portal coding style

This is a short document describing the preferred coding style for the
Mht Portal.  Coding style is very personal, and I won't _force_ my
views on anybody, but this is what goes for anything that I have to be
able to maintain, and I'd prefer it for most other things too.  Please
at least consider the points made here.

First off, I'd suggest reading PEP8 and strongly advice to follow it.

Anyway, here are some additions/changes to pep8 for Mht Portal:


		Chapter 1: Quotes

I strongly recommend to use single quotes everywhere except for when
you are writing strings that are:
	1. Directly shown to user
	2. Or includes single quotes
in that case you should use double quotes

		Chapter 2: Comments and Docstrings

Comments should show why you did, what you did and not on how it
works. And, Please comment your code!

I strongly recommend to follow pep257 for docstrings.
